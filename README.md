# Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It predicts a target variable based on multiple input features.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Multiple linear regression.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook implementing multiple linear regression.
- `economic_index.csv` — Dataset used for training the model.
- `README.md` — Project description and structure.

---

## 📊 Dataset: `economic_index.csv`

This CSV file contains economic indicators used as features to predict an economic index. Sample columns include:
- GDP
- Inflation Rate
- Interest Rate
- Unemployment Rate
- Economic Index (target)

## 🔧 Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## 🚀 Steps in Notebook

1. Load and inspect the dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess data.
3. Visualize feature correlations.
4. Split dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Train a Multiple Linear Regression model.
6. Evaluate performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error.
7. Visualize predictions.

## 💡 Outcome

The model predicts the economic index based on multiple variables and helps understand how each feature contributes to the final prediction.
